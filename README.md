# Elsan
A simple website in angular, created out of my own desire during an apprenticeship. I didn't know any business requirements, so I just looked <a href="http://www.elsan24.pl/">at their site</a> and presented it in a slightly different way. The project is fully functional, but needs a few small tweaks. Due to the fact that the project will not be officially hosted is abandoned.
